<p>
logline:<br> Murder of Doubt:
<br>
There are two storylines:<br>
The first one plays in an old town in Holland and is surrealistic with horror murders.<br>
The other one plays in Venice Beach and Santa Monica and is in the real world with a documentary style: Anna tries to get clear what happened on the evening before.
<p>
One of the psychedelic effects that slowly creeps in, is that most of the male voices in the film are the same: the Hand, the voice of the radio host, God, the bartender, inspector X, the healer, man on the cliff, the narrator on the Santa Monica pier.
